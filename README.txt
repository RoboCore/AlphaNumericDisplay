	RoboCore Alphanumeric Display Library
		(v1.0 - 30/10/2012)

  Alphanumeric Display library, based on the Sparkfun library for the driver.
	(last tested with Arduino 0023)

  Released under the Beerware licence




NOTE: wasn't able to use the Sparkfun library, therefore made some modifications to use
	with 3 drivers + display.


 Use with RoboCore's Alphanumeric Display/Driver:
