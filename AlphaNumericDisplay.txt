 30/10/12 - V_1.0

Alphanumeric Display library by RoboCore, based on the Sparkfun library (see 1st link).

NOTE: wasn't able to use the Sparkfun library, therefore made some modifications to use
	with 3 drivers + display.


 Use with Sparkfun's Alphanumeric Display/Driver:

NOTE: README.txt is from the Sparkfun library.
